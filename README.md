## My views about the tasks
- To be honest, I was a little skeptical about myself, whether ill be able to do the tasks, cause even though i had exposure to other coding languages, i had lost touch with them.But as i started doing the tasks, i was able to learn new things.

   I didnt have much idea about github and other stuff when i started doing the tasks, but looking at myself now, i can tell i have been able to learn a lot of things from these tasks.
- Where can i start😬, the tasks were really amazing, they covered many topics and i was able to grasp so much knowledge about so many new things from completing the tasks.
- Initially Every task felt hard, but as you start researching about how to approach it, how to handle it, how to tackle it, you will start to realize "I can do this task"😍.According to me that was the beauty of these tasks,it helped me understand, i can also learn new things and gain knowledge from it. 
- Overall all the tasks were amazing, nothing was simple to approach, but also nothing was too hard to approach as well. *I really had an amazing time doing this tasks, learning from them and it was a FUN Experience*🤪.
- The mentors assigned to me were very helpful, there were damn friendly and would reply almost immediately on my queries, let it be small or big. It was a great Experience working with them.

## My Introduction
My name is Sai Ganesh K, I am from Bangalore,Karnataka.
I was very exicited to apply to Amfoss Club, cause i had read about the club in many social media sites while researching about Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetam,Amritapuri.
I became intrigued about the club after learning how clubs work in Amrita and especially Amfoss.
Coming to my interests i recently developed an interest to coding, i actually had coding in my 10th ans 11th classes, but due to discontinuity i have lost touch with it, just remember the basics, but i want to learn and develop.
Apart from this I also like watching Anime,Tv shows,I used to practice piano but occasionaly play it now,i like reading books(novels)😜 and if i get interested in a thing i will get deep into it, until i am satisfied🤪.
