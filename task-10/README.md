Watching the Lectures of CS50 and solving the problem setsðŸ˜ƒ

## My Work

This was an amazing find, the lectures were awesome, the way he teaches was very good and then we had to solve the problem sets.I had watched the lectures long before doing the problem sets, so i had to refer some lectures and videos again while solving.

### CS50 IDE

Working with CS50 IDE was amazing, I really liked the interface of the IDE and the fact that its so easily available online and how once you get familiar it becomes damn user friendly.ðŸ˜†(If you close the tab by mistake and then start panicking about not saving your work, but turns out it auto savesðŸ˜«,such a reliefðŸ˜‚)

## Overall

Overall i really liked the lectures, i will have to watch it again to make the topics more clearer and solving the other sets(if i can), cause i want to remember the things i learnt from these lectures, i will definetly watch them again in my free time.
