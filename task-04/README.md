I tried this task a lot, hit many error, searched for many things, but i wasnt able to get the perfect output requiredðŸ¥².

I wasnt able to run the code in the pycharm IDE that i use as i did not have the "request" library, and i wasnt able to install.

I used the CS50 IDE instead and when i ran the code, a .json file along with the expected output link was generated, but to go further than that, i tried but i coudntðŸ˜Œ.

This was a good task, even though i wasnt able to learn the argspace library pefectly, i used websites and youtube tutorials to get to this code.
