# Let me C

I had to Debug a C code file in this task, it was kinda hard, to keep checking for the error, even though when you think you havent missed something the error always shows up🥲.

But at the end with the help of some articles and google😄, I was able to complete the task, i knew C++ a little not C,but it helped me initially to spot common errors😊.

It was a good task, and i am happy i was able to do it.😁
