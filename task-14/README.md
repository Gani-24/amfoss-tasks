 *This was by far the most fun task i did, well it was a game.*
 - I learnt Many things i didnt know from this task
 - I learnt many new commands and its uses and applications
 ** Some of the commands i learnt were
 ```
 find
 grep
 man ~~(this command can be used to find the use of a particular command, it helped me in understanding a particular command)
 ```
 *To find Particular files*
 ```
 find .type f | xargs file
 ```
 find could also be used to find files with specific instructions like file size and other things
 ###### Overall i had a good time doing this, i have uploaded all the passwords in a pass.txt file.
