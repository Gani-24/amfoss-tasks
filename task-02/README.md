## Begin your journey with Linux and Git
*This task was Super Fun to do* 

I learnt and became thorough with some new commands, Finally i got the coordinates, Which led me to the **Amrita Amritapuri Campus Computer lab**.

It was a interesting task to do, had to do some *Research* for the questions asked to get the coordinates, Learned some new things.

**ALL IN ALL HAD AN AMAZING TIME DOING THE TASK**
