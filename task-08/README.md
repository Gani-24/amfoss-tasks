# JSExplorer

This task we had to debug the html files provided to give out the neccesary form and use JS Explorer moving forward.




## My Experience😃

So i had to go through some research about html before i started debugging page 1.
I knew very little basics of html i remembered from school and Pu college time and along with some syntax research, i had to search about debugging a html file from various places😌.

It was becoming interesting from page 2, where we had to use JS Explorer to create things, the "w3schools.com/js" really helped me in creating page 2.

w3schools also helped me in creating a chart in page 3, i chose a PIE chart and created it with the help of that website and other sources.🧐



## Conclusion

This was a good task to do 😇 ,learnt about how JS explorer works, i believe this is like the first step and want to continue creating more things from what i have learnt from this task to become better and fluent in doing this on my own.
